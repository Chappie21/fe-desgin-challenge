# Chicks gold React with Vite and Typescript

This is a basic starter template for building React applications with Vite and TypeScript.

# Prerequisites

You must have node.js 18.16.1 LST installed and the npm package manager, you can also use Yarn.

Install Node.js

Official Node.js website and documentation: https://nodejs.org/en/

On the website, select version 18.16.1 LTS and download the executable if you are using Windows.

If you work with multiple Node.js versions, you can install NVM for your operating system and run the following commands:
